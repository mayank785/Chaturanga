# Chaturanga
Ancestor of chess using python
This is an ancient Indian game played by citizens of India. The game is mentioned in many of the ancient books.

# Rules
1. Raja (king) (also spelled Rajah): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga.
2. Mantri (minister or counsellor); also known as Senapati (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.
3. Ratha (chariot) (also known as Śakata): moves the same as a rook in chess- whereby the rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.
4. Gaja (elephant) (also known as Hastin): Can move two blocks diagonally in any direction.
5. Ashva (horse) (also spelled Ashwa or Asva): moves the same as a knight in chess.
6. Padàti or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry) (also spelled Pedati); also known as Sainik (warrior): moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move.

# Addition Rules
Stalemate was a win for a stalemated player. This rule appeared again in some medieval chess variants in England c. 1600. According to some sources, there was no stalemate, though this is improbable.
The player that is first to bare the opponent's king (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player's king on his next turn.
